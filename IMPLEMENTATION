TiMidity has a tone generator, two envelope generators, three low frequency
sine-wave oscillators, a low pass filter, and an effects unit.

The tone generator resamples instrument patches at the basic frequencies appropriate
for specific notes being played.

The envelope generators modulate each note with successively an attack phase, a
hold phase, a decay, and a release.  One of the generators affects amplitude,
and the other affects the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter.

The low frequency oscillators modulate amplitude (for tremolo), frequency (for
vibrato), and the low pass filter cutoff frequency.

The effects unit supplies echo, detuning, reverberation, chorusing, celeste, and
phaser effects.  Echo (done by generating extra echo notes) and reverbration
(done with a filter) implement midi reverberation.  Detuning (done by generating
extra pitch bent notes) and chorusing (done with a filter) implement midi
chorusing.

(The low pass filter is active only when KMidi's "filt" button is pressed on;
the effects filters are active only when KMidi's "eff" button is pressed on.)

Instruments may have either one or two tone elements, and for each of these,
a patch set may provide separate patches for different note-velocity ranges
(commonly for pianos) and for different note-pitch ranges.  GUS patch sets,
however, provide only one tone element and one velocity range per instrument.
