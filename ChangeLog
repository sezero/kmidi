Fri May 29 15:12:00 HST 1998  Greg Lee <lee@hawaii.edu>

	* merged in my version of TiMidity -- many changes:

     1. Made bank or drumset statements in .cfg files global,
	so that they have scope within subsequently "source"d files.
     2. Allowed end of line "#" comments in .cfg files.
     3. In playmidi.c, at the beginning of "dumb_pass_playing_list",
	I added a statement to decrement the number of file names
	to expect on the command line when running under Linux.
	Timidity was segfaulting.  But maybe the Linux system I tested
	it on had a bad version of "getopt".  I don't know.
     4. Changed names of #define's FSCALE, FSCALENEG to FRSCALE,
	FRSCALENEG to avoid conflict with a system #include file.
     5. Added loading of .fff files and playing stereo patches like
	those in the Utopia patch set. (See adagio "cfg.doc".)
     6. Added buffering to Sun & Linux output routines (sun_a.c &
	linux_a.c); changed Sun open of /dev/audio to accept default
	data rate when rate request can't be honored.
     7. Changed interpretation of envelopes so that sustain point is
	not held when patch mode is not MODES_SUSTAIN; note off event
	has no effect when .fff file says mode is "one-shot".
     8. Note played is now determined by patch frequency center and
	scaling info.
     9. Selecting "fast decay" no longer also controls speed of
	envelope attacks (which are now faster).
    10. Fixed bug in readmidi.c which prevented changing banks.
    11. Merged in Iwai's support for awe32 soundfonts.  Presets
	with two instruments are treated like Utopia's stereo
	patches, i.e. the two are sounded simultaneously.
